- New UPS efficient style
- 4.6k less belts (71% reduction)
- 1112 less inserters (43% reduction)
- 384 less boxes (100% reduction)
- 464 less balancers (99.4% reduction)
- 292 less factories (99.1% reduction)
- Removed all circuitry
- 1.2k more RedCircuit per minute (19% increase)
- Made the length of production lines about equal length to the loaders.  If the production lines are about the same length, the factories back up at about the same time.  This will help ensure the unloaders, which do not have balancers, unload evenly when the resources are near peak capacity.
